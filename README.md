##About TradeFair


##About TradeFair
TradeFair has been designed to fix two fundamental flaws in the construction industry: A lack of consistent and high quality workers for construction companies to hire and a lack of consistent, fairly paid work for those workers.

From personal experience in the construction industry, we realised how hard it is to find the quality of worker needed to take the stress away of management. There is nowhere that you can go to and find the right worker the right time. TradeFair fixes this problem and adopts the saying "Buy once cry once". Choosing the premium worker up front is actually the cheaper option, as poor quality labour can cost untold 1000's in repairs.

We also fix the problem of highly paid workers being unfairly paid for their quality of work and qualifications they provide. These workers who provide a high quality of work first-time round due to their training deserve to be compensated accordingly.

We solve these problems with one solution, automatic matching of companies (and their respective job they need doing) to a supply of highly qualified workers. These workers are matched based on multiple variables such as distance to job, relevant experience and more. This matching algorithm also ensures an equal distribution of work amongst the supply of tradespeople.

TradeFair saves money for companies and makes money for those who've worked for it.
